# Linear Regression

## Overview

<p>This project was made following the 1.5-hour long Coursera guided project <a href="https://www.coursera.org/projects/linear-regression-numpy-python">"Linear Regression with NumPy and Python"</a>.</p>
<p>It builds the linear regression algorithm from scratch and applies it on a fairly small dataset.</p>
<p>The dataset pertains to a bike sharing company that has bikes in various cities which provided various amounts of profit. Linear regression is used to help predict what profits can be made by visiting new cities with different amounts of population.</p>

## Usage

<p>Simply access the <a href="https://github.com/toni-the-dude/Linear-Regression/blob/main/Univariate%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb">jupiter notebook file</a> attached to this repository to be able to see the code in action.</p>

## Walkthrough

<p>The jupyter notebook is sectioned according to the steps I have taken. My various comments also help explain the code.</p>

## Conclusion

<p>This project proved useful in understanding Linear Regression and its uses, as well as in motivating me to further delve into Machine Learning.</p>
